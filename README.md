# GoLang test

This repo is for testing, experimenting, playing around with Go.

During the road of learning Go, I'll try code from various sources, so here I'll try to keep it organized in folders.

`basic-example` folder contains the first attemps with code with Go. Don't remember where they came from, I guess from the official page some years ago.
